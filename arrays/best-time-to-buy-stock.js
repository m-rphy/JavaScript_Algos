/*
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is 
the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a 
single day to buy one stock and choosing a
different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from 
this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit,
return 0.

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on 
day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is 
not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done 
and the max profit = 0.
