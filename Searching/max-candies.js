/**
 
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array candies. 
 Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies 
 of size candies[i]. You can divide each pile into 
 any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles 
 together.

 You are also given an integer k. You should allocate 
 piles of candies to k children such that each child 
 gets the same number of candies. Each child can take 
 at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies 
 may go unused.

 Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.

 Input: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
 Output: 5
 Explanation: We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of 
 size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. 
 We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, 
 and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. 
 It can be proven that each child cannot receive more 
 than 5 candies.

 Input: candies = [2,5], k = 11
 Output: 0
 Explanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in 
 total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives 
 at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and 
 the answer is 0.
